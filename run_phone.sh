# Builds, installs, and launches Where on the connected iPhone in one
# step. The app has no launch-arg parser, so any extra arguments are
# simply forwarded — typically you'll just run it without args.
#
# Usage:
#   ./run_phone.sh
#
# Requires the iPhone to be connected, unlocked, and trusted. Env vars
# (APPLE_TEAM_ID, IPHONE_UDID, IPHONE_BUILD_ID) come from
# ~/appledev/setupenv.sh — source it from your shell profile if you
# haven't already.
